# Conway's Game of Life
This was coded to practice Rust. And inspired by the suggestion for further projects by Robert Heaton at [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/).

## Controls
- R - Put the board in a random state (with a density of 0.1)
- E - Put the board in a blank or dead state
- G - Load the [Gosper Glider](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Gosper_glider_gun) from a text file
- C - Create a live cell at the mouse position
- Numpad Enter - Advance the state of the board

## TODO
- Implement better controls
- Allow the board to dynamically resize + pan over the board
- Add options for screen scaling
